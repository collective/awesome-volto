### Open-source websites built with Volto

The following websites have been built with Volto. You can find their complete source code by following their links. Please note that complex websites are built on top of Volto add-ons, and most of the time they're just an empty shell for the add-ons. You should check the dependencies in their `package.json` for more details.

The Plone Marketing Team copy-pastes the content of this section on a quarterly basis into [They use Plone 6](https://plone.org/why-plone/they-use-plone/they-use-plone-6).

To ensure your website gets the greatest exposure, add it both to Awesome Volto and the [Volto `README.md` under "Open-source websites built with Volto"](https://github.com/plone/volto/blob/main/README.md#open-source-websites-built-with-volto).
